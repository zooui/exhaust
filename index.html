             <ul>
            <li>paper baby berthas can be placed and parked anywhere</li>
            <li>you can get in, sit or lay in back, look around, open doors, exterior/interior hatches, compartments, windows, etc. or just watch and listen but i recommend hanging out inside and looking around for hidden thoughts</li>
            <li>window switches are attached to center console</li>
            <li>avoid trying to lock and unlock the car (buttons on doors), bertha's alarm is the worst teehee!</li>
            <li>enjoy the visualizer and let me know if you need any assistance or would like to connect your Bluetooth for chosen music :D</li>

            <summary>why?</summary>
            <ul>
            <li><i>Exhaust</i> is to explore the space for mental solitude as someone who drives every day, with the car serving as a container that can witnesses and participate in my daily emotional life while being an exhausting part of daily routine. My car currently works for my daily productivity and gets me from one place to another, as well as containing features that create a intimate or private setting that immobile interior spaces often don't have. With moments of unexpected mechanical failure from the car, it parallels the required consistency and motive to maintain the space and keep it functional. Similarly to my own overwhelm at times, my productive functions are put on pause until Bertha is fixed and safe to drive on the road.</li>

        <summary>each element</summary>
        <ul>
            <li>Visualizer - a flip through of every auto shop receipt that belongs to Bertha over the years, to represent the required consistency and responsibility as a driver</li>
             <li>Text labels - a format of common thoughts that appear in my head while driving, usually on multiple occasions due to the amount of driving I do. Labels are inspired by the "AbC" label on car radio (for "always be careful") that my parents stuck on the car as a reminder to drive safe when my family purchased Bertha in 2016.</li>
             <li>Paper models - My greatest challenge but with such reward of having a scaled down version of my car! The excess of models speaks for the repetition of driving and movement, and my desire for being able to take the container of a car anywhere to have handy when I need, but the real thing isn't always available <i>(wish I could put her in my pocket!)</i></li>
